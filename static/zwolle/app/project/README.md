The project's application specific components (html, js and css) are generated (or copied) into this folder.
Files with .js, .css extension in this folder will be picked up automatically picked up when building the app with Gulp.

There is an empty 'project.css' file already in this folder, which ensures that there is a project.min.css file after running Gulp, even if no project specific css files are included.
