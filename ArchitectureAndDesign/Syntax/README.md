Railroad diagrams of syntax
===========================

Direct link to [Current student version] (https://rawgit.com/AmpersandTarski/ampersand/master/ArchitectureAndDesign/Syntax/Current%20Student%20version/ui.xhtml)
------------------------------------------
The above link is the syntax as it is currently in use at the course [Ontwerpen met bedrijfsregels, course T18311] (http://portal.ou.nl/web/ontwerpen-met-bedrijfsregels/cursusinformatie) of the [Open University](http://www.ou.nl/). 

In the underlying folders you can find .ebnf files of specific versions of Ampersand. These files can be used to [generate Railroad diagrams at the site of Gunther Rademacher] (http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui)

Unfortunately there is currently no way to automatically keep the .ebnf files in sync with the Ampersand parser sourcecode. Therefore, the actual syntax may differ from what is mentioned in the .ebnf files.
