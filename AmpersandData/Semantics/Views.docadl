CONTEXT FormalAmpersand IN ENGLISH
INCLUDE "Atoms.docadl"
INCLUDE "Views.adl"

PURPOSE PATTERN Views
{+Views are meant to display atoms of a particular concept.
Views are designed to be both static and deterministic.
They are static, because the view is determined solely by the concept(s) of which an atom is an instance.
The choice of views is deterministic, because there is at most one View by which an atom can be displayed.
Assisted by error messages of the compiler, the user must ensure that the choice of views is deterministic.
+}

PURPOSE RELATION concept[View*Concept]
{+In Ampersand, the user defines each View for one particular concept.
This concept is associated to the view in relation concept[View*Concept].
The Ampersand parser ensures that this relation is UNI and TOT.
+}

PURPOSE RELATION hasView[Concept*Concept] -- hasView = concept~;concept/\I
{+The property that a concept has a view is registered in the relation hasView.
This property is computed by the system.
+}

PURPOSE RELATION viewBy[Concept*Concept] -- viewBy = isaStar;hasView - isaPlus
{+To define which concept must be viewed by which View, the relation viewBy is used.
This relation is computed by the system.
+}

PURPOSE RULE ChoiceView  -- viewBy~;viewBy |- I
{+In order to signal a possible ambiguity in the choice of views,
a process rule is in place to assist the user in maintaining a unique assignment of views.
+}
