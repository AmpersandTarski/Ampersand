This GitHub repository, Ampersandtarski/Ampersand, contains the source code of the Ampersand compiler.
It compiles and deploys an Ampersand script into software that serves as a prototype of the specified system.
It can also document that system by generating text, based on text fragments specified in the Ampersand script.
The purpose of Ampersand is to design information systems in a mathematically precise way, to speed up development and to prevent errors in the software as much as possible.
