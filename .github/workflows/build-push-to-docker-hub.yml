# This workflow builds and pushes Ampersand images to Docker Hub
# We want to have images for branches 'master' (latest) and 'development' and for all tags (i.e. releases, like e.g. v4.0.2)
# We use a Github Action from the market place. See: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images
