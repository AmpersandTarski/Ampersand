{- For the operators /, \, ;, ! and * we must not check whether the intermediate types exist.
   Suppose the user says GEN Student ISA Person and GEN Employee ISA Person, then Student `join` Employee has a name (i.e. Person), but Student `meet` Employee
   does not. In that case, -(r!s) (with target r=Student and source s=Employee) is defined, but -r;-s is not.
   So in order to let -(r!s) be equal to -r;-s we must not check for the existence of these types, for the Rotterdam paper already shows that this is fine.
