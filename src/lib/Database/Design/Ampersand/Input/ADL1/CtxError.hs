-- SJC: I consider it ill practice to export CTXE
-- Reason: CtxError should obtain all error messages
-- By not exporting anything that takes a string, we prevent other modules from containing error message
-- If you build a function that must generate an error, put it in CtxError and call it instead
-- see `getOneExactly' / `GetOneGuarded' as a nice example
-- Although I also consider it ill practice to export PE, I did this as a quick fix for the parse errors
