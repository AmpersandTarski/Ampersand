  --   Ampersand derives the process logic from the static logic by interpreting an expression in relation algebra as an invariant.
  --   So how does Ampersand derive dynamic behaviour from static rules? An example may clarify this:
  --   Suppose you have large shoes that do not fit through your trousers in any way.
  --   Does this have any consequences for the process of dressing in the morning?
  --   Well sure it has!
  --   Since your shoes won't fit through your trousers, you must first put on your trousers, and then put on your shoes.
  --   So the order of putting on trousers and putting on shoes is dictated by the (static) fact that your shoes are too big to fit through your trousers.
  --   When undressing, the order is reversed: you must take off your shoes before taking off your trousers.
  --   This example ilustrates how the order of activities is restricted by an invariant property.
  --   So it is possible to derive some dynamic behaviour from static properties.
  --   The following datatypes form a process algebra.
