-- | The intentions behind FSpec (SJ 30 dec 2008):
-- Generation of functional designs is a core functionality of Ampersand.
-- All items in a specification are generated into the following data structure, FSpec.
-- It is built by compiling an Ampersand script and translating that to FSpec.
-- In the future, other ways of 'filling' FSpec are foreseen.
-- All generators (such as the code generator, the proof generator, the atlas generator, etc.)
-- are merely different ways to show FSpec.
