# Configuration

You configure the precise actions of the compiler by specifying [Options](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/documentation/tree/5c45435a2b5cdd69129ba6ee9401819331fb531e/the-command-line-tool/options.md) on the command line. If you use the same configuration frequently, consider using a configuration file, so you don't have to remember all these options each time you call the compiler. The configuration file sits in the same directory as your model.
