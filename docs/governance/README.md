# How do we manage Ampersand?
The governance of Ampersand is founded on the following principles:
* Ampersand is a research project, driven by the academic virtues of curiosity, spontaneous collaboration and mutual assistance.
* The repositories are visible to the entire world, but contributions require membership of an Ampersand team, to prevent silly accidents.
* Maintainability is by far the most highly valued property of anything in the Ampersand project.
* There is no money involved.
* There are no deadlines.
* We continually draw on best practices from others to improve our productivity.

## Future directions
We lay out the future directions in terms of research questions.
Such topics are usually discussed on Ampersand days or physical meetings of the core team.
[Stef Joosten](https://github.com/stefjoosten) has a final say in this, to ensure progress.

## Decision making
The core team, consisting of [Stef Joosten](https://github.com/stefjoosten), [Han Joosten](https://github.com/hanjoosten), and [Michiel Stornebrink](https://github.com/Michiel-s),
makes all decisions.
All [Ampersand repositories](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski) are managed by the core team.

New contributors and temporary contributors are individuals with a GitHub identity, so that we can make them a member of the project.

## Management
The [Ampersand repository](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand) and [Prototype repository](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Prototype)
both have a "main" branch, which contains all releases as tags.
Contributors make pull requests to merge their branch into the main branch.
This merge also requires a code review by one of the core team members.
Automatic testing (by GitHub actions) ensures a minimal amount of hygiene.
We merge only compilable code that passes the regression test.
