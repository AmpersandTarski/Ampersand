# NoSQL storage

## Purpose

Data storage is a diverse landscape of technologies. Triple stores, graph databases, persistent event streaming are but a few technologies that have become commonplace. We want Ampersand to link up with such technologies to serve a wider spectrum of problems.

Ampersand is prepared for this by the plug-mechanism.
