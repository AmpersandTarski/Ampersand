# Plans

## Summary

This chapter discusses future plans. Click on the hyperlinks for details

* In this [video](https://youtu.be/SAzFxZ7Cz9I) discusses the plans in 7min30 \(in Dutch\)
* To understand our plans, this section describes [the current state of Ampersand](current-state.md).
* Instead of storing data to an SQL database only, we want to other types of databases to work with Ampersand as well. Especially [NoSQL databases](nosql-storage.md) \(e.g. triple stores, graph databases, persistent event streaming\) seem very suited for Ampersand.
* To generate APIs is what Ampersand does already. We also want to [generate documentation of the \(generated\) API](api-documentation.md) to make it more useful in real life.
* To work closer in sync with the semantic web we want to accept [OWL and RDFS input](owl-and-rdfs-input.md). Currently Ampersand accepts Ampersand-syntax, Archimate-xml, and Excel as input.
* To generate reactive web-applications instead of a classical object-oriented web-application is why we want to [refactor the Ampersand front-end](refactor-the-front-end.md).
