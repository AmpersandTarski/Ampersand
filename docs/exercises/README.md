# Exercises

This chapter contains material to help you mature your skills in Ampersand. They are somewhat larger than the exercises that are embedded in the theory. That makes these exercises suitable for classroom projects.

There may be exercises in another language than English, usually for a good reason.

Currently, there is only one exercise, the VOG \(Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag\). This exercise requires you to read pieces of Dutch legislation, so this exercise is in Dutch.
