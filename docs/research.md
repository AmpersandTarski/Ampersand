# Research

Research into Ampersand focuses on automatically generating information systems, investigating a language suitable for designing such systems, and communication of designs between stakeholders with vastly different backgrounds. The research is documented on [The Ampersand Project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Ampersand-automated-design-and-synthesis-of-information-systems-for-compliance-critical-applications) on Researchgate.

## Publications  
<!--  The main page in AmpersandTarski.github.io refers to this header, so please don't change it frivolously. -->
The following list gives an overview of publications by members of the Ampersand team.

In 2018 we published a paper that positions Ampersand as a reactive programming language:

Stef Joosten, [Relation Algebra as programming language using the Ampersand compiler](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352220817301499?via%3Dihub), Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming, Volume 100, 2018, Pages 113-129, ISSN 2352-2208, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.04.002.

The following paper illustrates how to use Ampersand as a programming language.

The following blog posts some research results into Amperspiegel, which is an extensible language building on the Ampersand foundation.

In 2015, we experimented with domain analysis, to obtain a different perspective on the Ampersand type system.

In 2013, we published the book that is use in the course "Rule Based Design" at the Open University of the Netherlands.

In 2011, we proved the soundness of the type system of Ampersand, which unlocked the Ampersand compiler for the public.

## Results  
<!--  The main page in AmpersandTarski.github.io refers to this header, so please don't change it frivolously. -->
The application [RAP](https://rap.cs.ou.nl) was built as an educational tool, and developed further into a tool in which anyone can build and run their own prototypes.

The project has contributed to the development of applications in relation algebra, which has lead to numerous publications in the [International Conference of Relation Algebraic Methods in Computer Science](https://ramics20.lis-lab.fr/).

Numerous students at the Open Universiteit have graduated in the context of Ampersand.

TNO has built ten information systems in production with Ampersand, of which [SETU](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl) is an example.

Several hundreds of students have completed the course [Rule Based Design](https://www.ou.nl/-/IM0403_Rule-Based-Design) at the Open Universiteit.

The Open Universiteit has published a book, Rule Based Design, as open educational content. This book has had 20.000 reads on Researchgate.
