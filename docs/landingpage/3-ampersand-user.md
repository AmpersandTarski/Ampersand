# How can I build an information system?
If you want to build information systems with Ampersand, you have come to the right place.

This page will help you build a working prototype of your information system and run it.

## Get started
* Do the [tutorial](../tutorial-rap4), to get an idea of an Ampersand application
* Understand the [architecture of an Ampersand application](../architecture-of-an-ampersand-application/README.md), so you can build, deploy, and maintain your Ampersand application better.
* Learn about the [syntax of Ampersand](../reference-material/syntax.md), to write correct Ampersand code.
* Learn about [relation algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) on Wikipedia, to understand more about this fascinating field of mathematics.
* Learn about using the [Ampersand compiler](../the-command-line-tool.md) from your command line interface (CLI), if you need to use the compiler as a stand-alone application.

## Resources
* There are many [modules available for re-use](../reusing-available-modules.md), which can save you time because they have been designed specifically for that purpose.
