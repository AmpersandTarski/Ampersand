The Ampersand programme is conducted at the Open University of the Netherlands in collaboration with and with contributions of TNO and Ordina.
This quaest is to find techniques of developing better information systems and to do that faster and quicker, for improving the administrative information provisioning.

Ampersand is about generating administrative systems from simple, yet formal specifications.
We aim at generating "all the way", which means that specifications are as close to ``the business'' as we can possibly get and the software is also being deployed in production.
