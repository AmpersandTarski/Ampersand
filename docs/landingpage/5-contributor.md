# Contributing to Ampersand

Many people have contributed to the Ampersand project in the past, each in her or his own way. We're very proud of the results and we are amazed daily of the software that tiny specifications can produce.

If you want to be part of it, contact [stefjoosten](<mailto:Stef.Joosten@ordina.nl?subject=Request demo meeting>) on Github to discuss your contribution.
Here are some links that are useful for contributors.
