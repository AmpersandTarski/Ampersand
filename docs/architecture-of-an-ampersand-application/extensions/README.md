# Extensions

The prototype has some built-in extensions. Some are experimental, others are pretty stable. This chapter describes them.

The extensions are described from a user perspective. You may expect enough information to use the extension you want. If not, please notify the authors.

The extensions are _NOT_ described from an implementors perspective. If you wish to change the extensions, you will need more information than is contained in this text. Please contact the authors for that purpose.
