# Documentation of Ampersand

This repository contains the documentation of Ampersand. You can read it [here](https://ampersandtarski.gitbook.io/documentation).

## How to modify this documentation

We have an automatic tool chain in use. It updates a [site with the documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/documentation) each time the master branch of the book is modified.

By far the easiest way is to use the online editor that goes with Gitbook. How to use it and how to get going with it can be found in the [this document](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ampersandtarski/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand).

If you are in doubt on how to use it, or you would like a demo of gitbook, ask [Han](mailto://han.joosten.han@gmail.com)!
