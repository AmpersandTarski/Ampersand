# Reusing Available Modules

## Sessions, Identity and Access Management \(SIAM version 3\)

You might want to know who is using your application. Or you might want to offer each one of your users some privacy when using your application. Logging in, passwords, authorizations, are typically used for such purposes. This field, also known as Identity and Access Management is covered in [this chapter](siam-sessions-identity-and-access-management-module.md).

The [SIAMv3 module](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/ampersand-models/tree/master/SIAMv3) gives you a selection of ways to organise that, ready for you to use.This module is located in the ampersand-models repository on [Github](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski). It is maintained by [Rieks Joosten](https://github.com/orgs/AmpersandTarski/people/RieksJ) from a closed repository at TNO \(git@ci.tno.nl:ampersand/models.git\).
