This lesson explains the VIOLATION mechanism in Ampersand.

## Why use violations?
Violations allow you to specify readable and user-friendly messages when the Ampersand run-time code signals inconsistencies in rules. 
A violation statement combines static text with dynamic content from the actual data.
Thus, you can assemble a sentence to let your users understand precisely which data is causing a rule violation.
In this way, you can help them understand what they must fix to resolve a violation.
