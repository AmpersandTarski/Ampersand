# Information Systems
This first lesson explains information systems.

Key takeaways:
1. An information system exists as the collective memory of an organization, so that the organization can act as one single actor.
2. An information system stores facts consistently, to prevent if from contradicting itself. This serves the purpose of integrity of data.
3. Every role gets his or her own view on the data stored in the system, to serve that role in doing his or her job.
4. An information system consists of multiple services, multiple data spaces, and multiple data streams, to support the continuity and flexibility of the organization it serves.
