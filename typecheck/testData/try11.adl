{-
   Purpose: a superficial check on type deduction
   Result: FAIL
   Reason: The type of I is a subset of r(line 6:6), so the type of r is not determined...
   Error message:

   The pattern named "Test11" contains errors in the rule at line 6:1:
   line 6:18, file "try11.adl"
       Cannot deduce a type for  I.
