The testData directory contains files that can be used to do a regression test of Ampersand. 

Currently, there are .adl scripts available in two kinds: 
* scripts that should pass parsing AND typechecking. These files are located in the directory `pass`
* scripts that should fail parsing or typechecking. These files are located in the directory `fail`.
