# Disable the standard build process which would use MSBuild:
build: off

# obtain the stack executable, and also perform a small hack which
# converts ssh-based git submodules to https-based ones, that 
# can be cloned without needing to mess about with ssh keys.
before_build:
- curl -ostack.zip -L --insecure http://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-i386
- 7z x stack.zip stack.exe
- sed -i 's/git@github.com:/https:\/\/github.com\//' .gitmodules
# Appveyor doesn't clone recursively.
- git submodule update --init --recursive

# prevent AppVeyor from building when it sees a new tag (later
# in this script we end up making a new tag when we push a release)
skip_tags: true

# perform the typical stack build, and also install the 
# ampersand.exe file that we will mark as an artifact
build_script:
# Suppress output from stack setup, as there is a lot and it's not necessary.
- stack setup --no-terminal > nul
- stack build --only-snapshot --no-terminal
- stack --local-bin-path . install ampersand
# Set a magical environment variable
- cmd: for /f %%i in ('stack exec -- ampersand -v') do set AMPERSAND_VERSION=%%i

# mark the file(s) as an artifact; this means AppVeyor will hang on to it after the build completes:
artifacts:
- path: ampersand.exe

# Auto-deploy
# specify that, for each build that completes, AppVeyor should push
# a release with the right tag to the GitHub releases page! 
# (Note: probably we would want to be a bit more 
# elaborate about when we push to the releases page; making sure 
# that we include proper release notes, etc.)
deploy:
  - provider: GitHub
    tag: 'ampersand-$(AMPERSAND_VERSION)'
    release: 'Release ampersand-$(AMPERSAND_VERSION)'
