   Purpose: This script shows that it is not always enough to have an intersection type
            to 'join' different concepts.
   Result: FAIL
   Reason: Ambiguity lures...  the type checker might give a suggestion!
   Error message:

   The pattern named "Test18" contains errors line 8:12, file "try18.adl"
       Relation  t  is ambiguous.
       Is it possible that you meant t[B*Y]?
       If so, please substitute t on line 8:12, file "try18.adl"
       by t[B*Y].
