{-
   Purpose: This is an attempt to mislead the type checker, by
            choosing a different source and target for t and u.
   Result: PASS
-- Reason: t/\u are in conflict (concepts B and E), but there is an intersection type (concept F) to resolve that.
           now s~ is in conflict with t/\u (A is not F), but there is an intersection type (concept D).
           The mischievous attempt to mislead the checker is that RULE r1 does refer to F indirectly.
