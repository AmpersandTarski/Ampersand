{- This test is all about the question of what is in the initial population. 
Are singletons, mentioned in terms only, part of that population?

Currently, a singleton is part of the initial population. In this case, a prototype cannot be generated, 
It gives the following error message:

Checking on rule violations...

Signals for initial population:
