CONTEXT TechDataModelTest IN ENGLISH

-- Kernel concepts should not get type Bool

SPEC B ISA A

CONCEPT E "testconcept E" -- disconnected concept, should not appear in technical data model

RELATION r1[B*C] [SUR,UNI,INJ]
RELATION r2[A*C] [SUR,UNI,INJ]
RELATION r3[A*D]

RELATION r5[X*B] -- should not point at sugar cube B, but at its root A

-- No table should be shown for X and D, as wide tables with one column are basically scalars
-- (fixing this will also remove disconnected concepts like E)

RELATION x[X*X] -- creates sugar cube for X in old version, as assocs point to concept 'X' but corresponding class has sql name 'X1'
