   Purpose: This script is meant show that ONE is not an ordinary concept.
   Result: FAIL
   Reason: ONE is the universal singleton concept, so:
    1.       I[ONE]=V[ONE*ONE]
    2.       If ONE ISA A, and we would show the atoms of A in an interface, we could see the representation of the atom that is the instance of ONE.
             Because ONE represents the universal singleton, we do not wish to represent its contents. Ever.
             So ONE ISA A should result in a failure.
   Error message:
The current error message is a syntax error. That is not the right kind of error, so we should make a ticket for that.
