   Purpose: This script is meant to study the ambiguity of interpretation in expressions with complements.
   Result: FAIL
   An ambiguity arises in type checking. Be more specific in the expressions -s and -q.
  You could add more types inside the expression, or write:
  (V[A*B] - s)
  (V[B*C] - q)
  Error at symbol () in file try14.adl at line 7 : 14

In issue #241 we have restored the law r-s = r/\-s. In order to achieve this, Bas had to tighten the ambiguity rules.
