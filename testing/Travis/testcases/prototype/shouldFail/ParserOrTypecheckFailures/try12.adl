{- 
   Purpose: to get a proper error message, which makes sense to the programmer.
   Result: FAIL
   Reason: the two occurrences of r on the right hand side of the equation
           are both diagnosed ambiguous, thus giving strange error messages.
   Message:
   The pattern named "Test12" contains errors:
   line 6:6, file "try12.adl":
       Relation  r  is declared as r[A*A],
       but its source, A, is in conflict with B    and its target, A, is in conflict with B.

   line 6:18, file "try12.adl":
       Relation  r  is ambiguous.
       Is it possible that you meant r[A*A]?
       If so, please substitute r on line 6:18, file "try12.adl"
       by r[A*A].
