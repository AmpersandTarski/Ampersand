PURPOSE CONTEXT Ticket237 MARKDOWN
{+This script should produce a type error, because `I[Fruit] /\ -I[Citrus]` is ambiguous.
It can be interpreted as `I[Fruit] /\ (V[Citrus]-I[Citrus])`  or as  `I[Fruit] /\ (V[Fruit]-I[Citrus])`
The ambiguity can be exposed by adding the following population:

    RELATION r[Fruit*Citrus]
    POPULATION r[Fruit*Citrus] CONTAINS
      [ ("1", "2") ; ("2", "2") ; ("3", "1") ]
-}
