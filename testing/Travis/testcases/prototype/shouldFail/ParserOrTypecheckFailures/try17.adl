{-
   Purpose: This script shows that a type conflict (between A and B) can be resolved
            by defining a union type D.
   Result: FAIL
   Reason:  This requires an intersection type between A and B, which is not there.
   Adding RULE I[E] = I[A]/\I[B] helps, because this yields concept E to be the type between s and t.
