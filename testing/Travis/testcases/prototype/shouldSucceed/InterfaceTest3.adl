{-
The type of the box is evident: it must be [B], because of the explicit type of the interface. 
Hence, the type of `self:I` must be infered to B
However, in Ampersand v2.2.1.1026 we get the following error message:

Error(s) found:
line 8:13, file "InterfaceTest3.adl":
    the source and target of  I
    are in conflict with respect to concepts A and B.
