   Purpose: This file illustrates the need for a "closed world assumption".
   For practical purposes, we need to be able to say 'not'. For example:
   For each order that has been ordered by a client, must either be a client to receive that order, or it has not (yet) been accepted by a vendor.
   Desired Result: PASS
