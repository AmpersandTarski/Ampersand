{- This tiny script is perfectly allright. It could be succesfully compiled with Ampersand v3.2.0[master:62e159f*] 
   However, it fails when using Ampersand v3.3.0[master:91e0569]
   It throws the following error:

Error(s) found:
Representation mismatch
    Found: `2`,
    as representation of an atom in concept `B`.
    However, the representation-type of that concept is (implicitly) 
    defined as ALPHANUMERIC. The found value does not match that type.
