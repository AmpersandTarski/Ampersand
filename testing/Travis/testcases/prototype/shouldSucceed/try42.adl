{-
   Purpose: a superficial check on type deduction
   Result: PASS
   Reason: The type of I cannot always be determined from its context
   The following type errors have been found in the past:

prototype: !fatal 428 (module Core.AbstractSyntaxTree) Ampersand v3.0.1.1261:126
2M
  Cannot intersect (with operator "/\") expression
   EDcV [ONE*A]
   with EIsc (EDcI A,ECps (EDcD RELATION s [A*B] Nothing PRAGMA "" "" "",EFlp (E
DcD RELATION s [A*B] Nothing PRAGMA "" "" ""))).

NOTE In version v3.0.1.1261 this error occurs, but it dissapears when the expression in the box is simplified to : (I /\ s;s~ )
