CONTEXT EscapeTest IN ENGLISH

PURPOSE PATTERN EscapeTest
{+
This pattern tests escaping capabilities of the Prototype generator by using 
special characters on all possible constructs.
-}

-- Special characters that may cause problems:

-- php strings:         '"$\
-- javascript strings:  '"\
-- html:                <>&
-- url:                 &/?%  ..
-- in filenames:        /

-- String with all characters combined: " ' \"  $ \\ < > & / ? % end"

-- Results
-- Label: ok
-- Atom: ok, \ seems to be filtered from atoms by Ampersand
-- Interface: / leads to problem with filenames in old generator (TODO)
-- Concept: old Installer.php fails, so not tested yet. (TODO)
-- Relation: can only be identifier, so no special characters (TODO: why not?) --HJO: The reason is that relations are translated into column names in the database. This would become a serious cause of nasty problems, so we forbid it.
