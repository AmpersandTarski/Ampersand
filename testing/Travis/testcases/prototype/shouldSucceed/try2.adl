CONTEXT Test IN ENGLISH
  CLASSIFY A ISA "A_Or_B"
  CLASSIFY B ISA "A_Or_B"

PATTERN Test2
RELATION r[X*Y]
RELATION s[X*A]
RELATION t[B*Y]
RELATION t[Q*Y]
RULE Test: r = s;t[B*Y]
CLASSIFY D IS A/\B
-- was:  RULE I[D] = I[A]/\I[B]
-- RULE 'THING'[A] |- t[B*Y];V[Y*A] -- there is something of A in t

{-
   Purpose: This script shows that a type conflict (between A and B) can be resolved
            by defining an intersection type D.
            Besides, it shows that the type checker can choose the right type for 
            subterm t, which is t[B*Y] (line 6)
   Result: PASS
   Reason: the type on ; is inferred as I[D]
