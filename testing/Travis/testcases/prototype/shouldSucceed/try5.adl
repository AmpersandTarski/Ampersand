   Purpose: This is an attempt to mislead the type checker, by
            choosing a different source and target for t and u.
   Result: PASS
-- Reason: t/\u are in conflict (concepts B and E), but there is an intersection type (concept F, rule r1) to resolve that.
           Now s~ is in conflict with t/\u (A is not F), but there is an intersection type (concept D).
           The mischievous attempt to mislead the type checker is that it must derive that A/\F=D

Proof:
   A/\F=D
= {CLASSIFY r0: D = (A/\B)/\E}
   A/\F=(A/\B)/\E
= {CLASSIFY F = B/\E}
   A/\(B/\E)=(A/\B)/\E
= {/\ is associative}
   True
