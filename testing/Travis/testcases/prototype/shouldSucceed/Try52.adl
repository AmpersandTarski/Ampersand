{-The purpose of this test is to check whether overloading works.
The following experiment should succeed:
compile a prototype with 
D:>Prototype --verbose -pD:\htdocs\klad Try52.adl
Then try to insert tuples in r[A*B] and r[C*D] and verify that they are registered in the correct place.

Note that the sentinel cannot perform this test (yet?), so it must be performed by hand.
