* [Issue #1084](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand/issues/1084) Add template attributes to BOX syntax
* **Breaking change** Because of the implementation of feature of #1084 we could greatly reduce the number of BOX templates (e.g. ROWS, ROWSNL, HROWS and HROWSNL are merged into a single template). Documentation of new templates can be found [here](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/prototype/tree/master/templates).
  This breaking change presented an opportunity to rename the built-in templates to more self explaining template names:
  * ROWS -> BOX \<FORM\>
  * COLS -> BOX \<TABLE\>
  * TABS -> BOX \<TABS\>
* Update default prototype framework version to v1.6.0, which includes new templates as described above
