## v3.5.0   (28 apr. 2016)
This is the first release of 2016. We are happy announce that we have much more possibilities on creating nice interfaces for the prototype application. Apart from that, lots of bugfixes have been made, and some other features have been introduced.

## releases prior to v3.5.0 did not have proper release notes. Anybody interested should have a look at the Git history.
